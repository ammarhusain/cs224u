    "- Experiment with features based on the context outside (rather than between) the two entity mentions âÂ that is, the words before the first mention, or after the second.\n",
    "- Try adding features which capture syntactic information, such as the dependency-path features used by Mintz et al. 2009. The [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) toolkit contains a variety of [parsing algorithms](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.parse.html) that may help.\n",
    "- The bag-of-words representation does not permit generalization across word categories such as names of people, places, or companies. Can we do better using word embeddings such as [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)?\n",
